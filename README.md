# About what this project - The Cloud Resume Challenge

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a project created by Forrest Brazeal, a cloud advocate and AWS Community Hero. It is designed to help people learn and showcase their skills in cloud computing, particularly with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The challenge involves creating a resume-style website and deploying it on AWS. Participants are encouraged to use various AWS services like Amazon S3 for hosting static content, Amazon DynamoDB for storing data, AWS Lambda for serverless functions, and more. The idea is not only to demonstrate technical skills but also to gain practical experience by building a real-world project.
